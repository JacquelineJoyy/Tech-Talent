    <h2> <span style="color:rgb(214, 102, 4);font-weight:bold">History of IMPRINT </span> </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Imprint Church was founded in 2017 in Leicester by Reverend Wole Agbaje. In Woles'second year at university in
        Leicester,
        he had a dream one night about forming a Gospela Showcase to tell the story of Jesus through creative media like
        drama, poetry, dance, video visuals and music.
        He felt God say that it was going to be a movement called IMPRINT and it would bring his prodigals home.
        He decided to tell some of my friends! In March 2015 they launched the first ever IMPRINT Gospel Showcase at the
        Leicester Studentsâ€™ Union. This hosted a total of 400 young adults, which wasn't expected by the team at the
        time. It was a packed night, and as they shared the gospel, they saw young adults dedicate their lives to Jesus
        and get involved in a local church.</p>

    IMPRINT Church Leicester was launched on 8th October 2017 and itâ€™s grown from six friends to over 200 people. <br>

    <h3> <center> <span style="color:rgb(214, 102, 4);font-weight:bold">The Vision of IMPRINT </span> </center>  </h3>
    <p> </p><center>  At IMPRINT, we want to see a generation from all types of backgrounds not defined by their past, insecurities, <br>
        failures, sin, shame, guilt, approval from others, defaults and shortcomings but a generation completely defined <br>
        by what God says about them. <br>
        As a result, they live in a quiet, humble boldness to be all that God has called them to be. <br>
        They are the dreamers and the risk-takers. <br>
        The servants and the leaders. <br>
        The counsellors and the preachers. <br>
        The healers and the deliverers. <br>
        They are the sons and daughters of God. <br>
        And because of their constant pursuit to commune with Jesus and be like him, their very nature shifts the 
        culture. <br>

        <strong> <em> They are IMPRINT!</em> </strong>
